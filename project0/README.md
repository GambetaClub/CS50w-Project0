# Project 0
This website is for finding other players online, either for playing sports or videogames. It has four bound links to other webpagesâ€”three of these links related to the main page. The remaining page is foreign to the main website. The main functionalities do not work because it needs more work in other areas, such as signing up or logging in. However, the webpages and values for taking the inputs from the users are there. 
The rest of the requirements are there.
